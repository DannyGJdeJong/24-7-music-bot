# 24/7 Music Bot for Discord
Just a Discord bot that repeats the same mp3 over and over and over and over...

## Set-up:
Name the mp3 you want to play on repeat `file_to_play.mp3` and replace `assets/file_to_play.mp3` with it.

Fill in your bot token in `.env`.

Run the bot using `docker-compose up -d --build`.

Add the bot to your server and summon it to a voice channel by using the `^join` command.
